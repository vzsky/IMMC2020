In this problem, we are required to do 4 main tasks:

1. Create a mathematical model that can calculate the competitive rate of each products from essential factors

2. Create a mathematical model that can calculate the damage of each floor plan layout

3. Place each products into the original floor plan layout

4. Create a new floor plan layout that decreases the potential damage and increase the expected sale profits

\noindent This can be further split into subtasks:

\noindent Task 1

a. Identify factors from information given in the products list, and researches that affects rivalry of the products

b. Calculate how each factor affect the rivalry in term of function

c. Calculate final competitive rate or rivalry based on the effects of each factor

\noindent Task 2

a. Calculate the competitive rate for each products using the created model

b. Calculate the number of people passing that products shelf

c. Calculate the chaotic value of each walkway / shopping lane 

d. Calculate the chaotic value of each intersection 

e. Calculate the overall chaos by considering the total chaotic value of the walkways and corners.

\noindent Task 3

a. Optimize the floor plan by organizing product stores position

\noindent Task 4

a. Try to reduce intersection which affects major part in chaos

b. Try to distribute people into distinct parts of shop to reduce chaos which is caused from many people being together in one place

c. Create model that satisfied the conditions

d. Use the model to calculate chaos which determines damage of the original floor plan layout

e. Use the model to calculate chaos which determines damage of the proposed floor plan layout
