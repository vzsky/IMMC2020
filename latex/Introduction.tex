\ \ \ \ Flash sales are originally hosted to target consumers to shop at the local store in the holiday season or on the day people don’t go to work. Flash sales offer a huge discount to attract buyers in the expectation that the buyers will as well, spend on other regular price products. Undoubtedly, shoppers arrived at the entrance early and chaotically rush in. This chaos causes stampede, products damaging, and traffic jams. \newline \par
When flash sales are hosted, it’s important to capitalistically consider profit from the event, which is not only the money, but also the client bases, and brand advertising. The main aim of hosting the flash sale is to attract people to buy products, in this case, electronic appliances, and devices. The problem of hosting a flash sale is the potential damage from the accidental collision of the buyer against the products. \newline \par
We are proposing a way to organize the event venue of the electronic flash sale with a given product list to minimize the level of damage and increase the sales.
