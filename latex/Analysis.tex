\ \ \ \ Since the layout we get is from the permutation that the code generated. It would be considered as the best one among other permutation. 
\newline

\textbf{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our new floor plan layout is better than the original one
        \newline
        \ \ \ \ - expected damage is lowered
        \newline
        \ \ \ \ - potential profit remains the same
        \newline
        \ \ \ \ - people will walk in more orderly way (straight line with no corner having products)
    \item Our new products layout is the best for this floor plan layout
        \newline
        \ \ \ \ - tested among all possible permutations
        \newline
        \ \ \ \ - people are ideally randomly distributed to all lanes
        \newline
        \ \ \ \ - each lane has all types of products
    \item Our layout is easy-to-use
        \newline
        \ \ \ \ - our layout contains floor plan and specific location to place the products
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The floor plan layout relies on mathematical model
        \newline
        \ \ \ \ - this layout is optimal only for this mathematical model
        \newline
        \ \ \ \ - changing in mathematical model might make this layout not optimal
\end{itemize}
